# Skinform: A Pore-Clogging Ingredient Checker

## About

This project provides a tool for users to identify potential pore-clogging ingredients in a wide variety of personal care products, including skincare, makeup, haircare, and body washes. The goal is to help individuals make informed choices about the products they use daily by analyzing their ingredient lists. Users can either search for products in our extensive database or paste an ingredient list to instantly check for potential pore-clogging ingredients. This tool empowers users to reduce irritants in their routines and optimize their product choices for healthier skin and hair.

## Features

- **Product Search**: Users can search through the database to find products and check their ingredients for pore-clogging substances.
- **Ingredient Checker**: Users can paste a productâ€™s ingredient list to check for pore-clogging ingredients instantly.
- **Pore-Clogging Ingredient List**: The full list of pore-clogging ingredients is available for users to browse and will be displayed on the page. This allows users to see exactly which ingredients are flagged as pore-clogging in our checker, so they know what our tool is scanning for.
